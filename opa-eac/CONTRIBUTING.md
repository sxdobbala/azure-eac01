# Contributing to everything-as-code

## Introduction

Everything as Code is like any other application code that represents infrastructure, security, compliance and operations to ensure agility while maintaining governance.
Terraform  is used as a tool for building, changing, and versioning of infrastructure, security and compliance polices.
Helm is used for managing packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources and application deployment.
Finally, we construct the build pipelines for our software using a Jenkins Groovy DSL.. Contribution includes adding functionalities to the common patterns.
