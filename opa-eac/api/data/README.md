# Data Folder

The python scripts in this folder are dummy test scripts which parrot input parameters back when invoked. The input parameters are exact copies of the parameters expected by the real scripts that OPA uses for orchestration and operations.

To use these scripts place them in a folder on an EC2 instance and update OPA Master with the correct script path/names before invoking via lambdas.
