| Req ID   | Requirement                                                  | Related AWS Config Policies                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **2.1**  | _Key Strength_: Cloud native functionality protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of data must be enabled to encrypt data at rest and in motion. | All AWS services eligible for encryption use the [AES-256 encryption algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/crypto-intro.html). They are [aws_redshift](https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/aws_redshift),  [aws_rds](https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/aws_rds), [aws_s3](https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/aws_s3), [aws_efs](https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/aws_efs) and all AWS managed services |
| **2.2** | _Key Management_: Optum Technology will manage keys and certificates associated with encryption. Storage at Optum technology data centers or on approved hardware service modules required. Auditing of all key management activities required | [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) will be our standard key management solution. KMS uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules to protect the security of our keys and also integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide the audit of all key usage to help meet our regulatory and compliance needs |
| **2.3** | _Data in Transit_: Cloud native functionality protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of data in transit must be implemented | All of our public facing network interface uses Optum issued[Venafi] ceritifcates managed by [AWS certificate manager]( https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/). These interfaces are AWS Load balancer[ELB] and CloudFront. In addition,communication within VPC is also encrypted. |
| **2.4** | _Data at Rest_: Cloud native functionality protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of data at rest must be implemented | All data storage options we are using S3, EFS, EBS supports encryption at rest with KMS key. They all encryption uses AES-256 encryption algorithm |
| **3.1** | _Information System Boundaries_: A native collection of solutions shall be selected to provide information system boundaries for information services, users, and information systems to prevent information leakage and unauthorized access | The VPC module allows users to provision an isolated VPC network for their AWS resources. The VPC default NACL's permissions that allow all IPv4/IPv6 traffic are automatically removed by Terraform. The created VPC defaults to zero ingress or egress from the internet. The module can be passed a variable to setup an internet gateway and public subnets to go along with it. Public and private subnets are created to further segment the VPC. Route tables are used to manage traffic to these subnets of which the private subnet has no internet access by default. Custom NACL's are also generated for the VPC subnets with default rules to only allow http/https and will deny all other traffic until additional rules are added. The module also supports interface and gateway endpoints to allow for the setup of secure communication between services inside the AWS network.We run Egress proxy in public zone instead of NAT Gateways to audit and control egress network access |
| **3.2** | _Role-Base Access Control(RBAC)_: Groups of information services, users, and information systems shall be isolated logically and virtually to prevent information leakage and unauthorized access | IAM controls in AWS are used to provide service and human accounts with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their function, in their respective AWS account(s). This is provided through SSO federation with on-prem AD. During account creation IAM roles are created and synced with on-prem to provide users with initial RBAC configuration. Changes made to our environment is all from service account plugged into our Jenkins instance. We currently only have a nonprod account, but will have 2 seperate accounts (nonprod and prod) to manage the blast radius |
| **3.3** | _Encrypted Channels_: Native functionality providing virtual boundaries shall be implement to support confidentiality and integrity of information in transit | See policies in requirement 2.3 |
| **4.1** | _Federated_: Native functionality supporting federation of identities and access rights from UHG/Optum user directories shall exist to support Single Sign-on (SSO) of privileged human and non-human users, services and computing devices preventing credential abuse | Federation to AWS exists.

Confidentiality, integrity and availability is shared responsibility between AWS and us. We are making  sure all security controls  including but not limited to encryption[KMS & ACM], network polices[SG &NACL], control mechanism for web exploits[WAF], configuration source controls [Terraform /GIT Code review]are in place |
| **5.3** | _Internal information Systems_: Functionality ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of internal information systems shall exist preventing exploitation technical security weaknesses | Our internal facing systems contains both fully AWS managed services and customer managed services. Confidentiality, integrity and availability is shared responsibility between AWS and us. We are making  sure all security controls  including but not limited to encryption[KMS & ACM], network polices[SG &NACL], configuration source controls [Terraform /GIT Code review]are in place. In addition we leverage AWS inspector for vulnerability scanning, OSSEC for host intrusion detection, egress proxy for DLP along with AWS security best practices for different services |
| **5.4** | _Patch Management_: Native functionality providing patching of information system flaws shall exist to protect against known security vulnerabilities and exploits-the-wild | We have well defined pipeline to build and distribute images within our AWS regions.  AMI Images are continuously built from base Amazon patched images. Additionally these AMIs will also have any agents and updates required by Optum that are above and beyond the base AMI. An AWS SSM agent is also installed and enabled for the images which allows for the usage of AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate patching and security updates for managed images as well as using AWS Systems Manager Configuration Compliance to scan images for patch compliance. More [here]( https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/aws_ami) |
| **5.5** | _Malicious and Mobile Code Protection_: Native functionality preventing execution of malicious code shall exist preventing compromise of information systems by manual or automated attacks | Web application firewall will be implemented.

| **6.2** | _CMDB_: Functionality shall exist enabling monitoring and remediation of configuration baselines of CSP environments | AWS Config enables resource inventory and change management as well as Config Rules to confirm that resources are configured in compliance with policies that we define. Launchpad defines the compliance rule to compare & compile the actual state vs state documented in terraform state file |
| **7.1** | _Defense in Depth_: Native functionality shall be deployed in a tiered architecture model to protect ingress and egress perimeter routes against blended threats | Because all network ingress and egress information is included in our source tree, any scans of environment can happen against that source tree to confirm that there are no violations of policy.  This is both detective, preventive, and corrective.  Because if the current environment doesn't match whats in the production/stage branch it will be obvious when you run a "terraform plan" command. The Launchpad  Config compliance rules are expected to alert us if there is any misconfiguration that requires changes |
| **7.2** | _Isolation Stack_: Native functionality providing segregation, segmentation and isolation | We have isolated stack. We use NACL & SG to implement network zones called "public" & "private". Our only ingress point is through ELB in public zone allowing only HTTPS into any service running inside VPC. Security groups are chained to manage layer 4 firewall between web -app-db.We run Egress proxy in public zone instead of NAT Gateways to audit and control egress network access. We use amazon system manager pattern which uses the local SDK and strong au/az/audit for those commands to be executed on the hosts. We don't peer our VPC's |
| **7.3** | _DLP Stack_: Native functionality preventing the loss of data at rest or in transit | We will use [Egress Forward proxy](https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/aws_egress_proxy) for controlled outbound access.

Perimeter control, Ingress, Egress, which are all turned off by default are managed through this means. OSSEC for IDS, installed on every machine. AWS Inspector for vulnerability detection is installed on every machine,All security events sent to SIRC,ACL's on network, No ingress/egress by default. Application alerts for volumes (via APM system),Flow logs for network access auditing within VPC and All outbound internet access are controlled and audited through egress proxy |
| **8.1** | _DevOps_: Functionality must exist to capture security events at the software level when custom code is created | AWS Launchpad works by configuring the CloudTrail and Config services to send logs to S3 buckets in a Central Management Account.
